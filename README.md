### What I learned

Using an API to get JSON message and incorporating async and await into the app

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
async function advice() {
    const message = await fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice");
    const response = await message.json();
}
```
